## async

Async programming is a common and major part of any javascript application.
Async code is prune to errors and hard to debug so we need a good toolset to deal with the problems that come with writing async code.

### Lesson Plan

- What is async code example that finish
- What is Promise
- Create promise
- subscribe to promise with then
- promise chaining
- dealing with errors
- async await functions
- async code example that doesn't finish
- data stream
- what is rxjs
- create observable
- subscribe
- subscription
- operators
- subject
- angular autocomplete example

### EX

- Create a folder and init npm and install typescript and init typescript
- install rxjs
- combineLatest, merge, concat, from, of, throw, catchError, filter, debounceTime distinctUntilChanged, map, mergeMap, pluck, tap, delay, finalize,
- for each one of those operators try to use them and see how it transforms you data stream
- you can use those operators on Observable or Subject
