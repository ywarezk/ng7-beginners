- grab the email input in the login class
- grab the password input in the login class
- when the user submits the form trigger a method in the login component class.
- the submit method should send the email and password to the service, get true or false from the service if the credentials are valid and print in the login component template if login is success or fail

### Ex.

- take the background directive and make it accept a color through the attribute and set the color dynamically.

### EX.

- generate a new application
- create a service with an array of strings
- generate a new component and place the component selector in the app component template
- Inject the service to the component we created
- display the array from the service in the child template
